== The code base audience
Code is read by at least two audiences: the machines that execute
the instructions and the humans who write, maintain, or extend it.
Code written for human comprehension tends to result in carefully
constructed and well documented assets that are inexpensive to
maintain, extend, or reuse. This is often called **Living Code**.

Code that cannot be understood by humans after it is written is often
called **Dead Code**footnoteref:[deadcode,Dead code becomes unusable because
blueprints and/or testing systems don't exist, have become inaccurate, or
no longer work. It's a good thing structural, automotive, and aerospace
engineers aren't so lax about these controls.]. This code becomes
prohibitively difficult and expensive to maintain, extend, or reuse
and it is a **technical debt**footnoteref:[techdebt,
Technical debt is the deferred cost of undocumented process and systems.]
that stifles innovation.

A good standard helps us create well documented **Living Code** that can
grow with our product and organization. A comprehensive standard is
arguably more valuable for JavaScript than with other stricter languages.
JavaScript’s flexibility can open a Pandora’s
Box of syntax and practice. Stricter languages have a good deal of
structure and consistency built-in. Developers must actively apply
convention to attain the same results with JavaScript.

This standard has continuously evolved over many years and is used in
many open source and commercial projects. Appendix Y provides a three-page
quick-reference guide which dispenses with any explanations. However,
if you want to know *why* we recommend a convention, keep reading.

== JavaScript versions
Let's review how JavaScript versions are named and why this
standard considers ES5.1 the latest usable version.

=== ECMA, ECMAScript, and ES
Development on the JavaScript language has accelerated over the past decade as
vendors have stopped competing and started collaborating on making the
lanugage better all centered around the ECMAScript specifications. All these
acronymns can be confusing so let's clear things up.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International[ECMA International]
is a standards organization that changed its name from European Computer 
Manufacturers Association in 1994 to reflect its broader ambitions. ECMA is no
longer considered an acronymn but is apparently retained for the pleasant
sounds that occur when one tries to pronounce it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript[ECMAScript] is a language standard
created by ECMA International. **ES** is contraction of **ECMAScript**. Thus
the **ES6** and **ECMAScript 6** are the same thing. Clever, eh?

=== Current ES Versions and supported platforms
Table X.1 shows the major JavaScript versions that have been released. Later
specifications have been mostly backward-compatible.

.Table X.1 -- Preferred names of JavaScript versions
[cols="",]
|============================================
| Year | Pref. Name | Alternate         | Highlights
| 1997 | ES1        | ECMAScript 1      | You gotta start somewhere
| 1998 | ES2        | ECMAScript 2      | Compatible with ISO 16262
| 1999 | ES3        | ECMAScript 3      | Regular expressions
| ---- | ES4        |         ----      | Abandoned
| 2009 | ES5        | ECMAScript 5      | Strict mode, JSON
| 2011 | ES5.1      | ECMASCript 5.1    | Compatible with ISO 16262:2011
| 2015 | ES2015     | ES6, ECMAScript 6 | ES6 Harmony, for/of, promises
| 2016 | ES2016     | ES7, ECMAScript 7 | ES7 Harmony, Exponent, Array includes
| 2017 | ES2017     | ES8, ECMAScript 8 | SIMD types, await/sync
| ---  | ESNext     |         ----      | Cool stuff
|============================================

As of 2015, ECMA discourages the use of a single version numbers in favor
of the year of release. Thus while using ES5.1 is fine, they prefer we use
ES2015, ES2016, ES2017 instead of ES6, ES7, or ES8. Thanks to 
https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c[Codeburst.io]
for help sorting this out!

At the time of writing (fall 2017) IE 11 held around 11% market share and the
highest level of JavaScript it supports well is ES5.1. This is the feature level that
most public sites should and is the basis for this standard.
Kanagax has provided a very https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/[helpful chart]
so we can keep an eye on popularity. Once IE 11 use drop below 1% we will
will go all-in on ES2015.

== Variables
Variables can contain array, functions, numbers, object, strings,
`null`, or `undefined`. Some JavaScript implementations may make
internal distinctions between integers, 32-bit signed, and 64-bit
double-precision floating point numbers but there is no formal means to
enforce this.

Provide variables with meaningful names as shown in Listing X.1 so we
won’t have to insert a clumsy time-and-focus-sapping description every
time a variable is used.

.Listing X.1 -- Variables with meaning
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var x = 'Fred';
function p () { console.log( 'Hello ' + x ); }
p();

// == Prefer ==
var person_name = 'Fred';
function sayHelloFn () { console.log( 'Hello ' + person_name ); }
sayHelloFn();
----

Minimize the effort required to understand why a variable exists and
what it contains. This frees the mind to focus more important
areas such as application structure and logic.

=== Abbreviate smartly
- Do not abbreviate short words.
- Remove most articles, adjectives, and prepositions from names.
- Use standard abbreviations and acronyms where they exist.
- Prefer truncated names to contractions.

.Listing X.2 -- Abbreviations
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var dgClrStr = 'brown';
function walkWithTheBrownDog () {...}
for ( var q = 0; q < 9; q++ ) ...
var denormalizationMap = {...};
var dnmlztnMap = {...};

// == Prefer ==
var dogColorStr = 'brown';        # <1>
function walkDogFn () {...}       # <2>
for ( var i = 0; i < 9; i++ ) ... # <3>
var denormMap = {...};            # <4>
----
<1> Do not abbreviate short words
<2> Discard articles and prepositions
<3> Use standard i, j, k for integers
<4> Truncate instead of contract

=== Replace comments with meaningful names
Name variables to describe why they needed and what data type we
expected them to contain. The first consideration is important in any
language; the second is useful for loosely-type languages
like JavaScript. Listing X.3 shows variables named by purpose and type.

.Listing X.3 -- Names with purpose
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
// 'creators' is an object constructor we get by
// calling 'makers'. The first positional argument
// of 'makers' must be a string, and it directs
// the type of object constructor to be returned.
// 'makers' uses a closure to remember the type
// of object the returned function is to
// meant to create.
//
var creators = makers( 'house' );

// == Prefer ==
var make_house_fn = curry_build_fn({ _item_type_ : 'house' });
----

Figure X.1 illustrates how we convey all the meaning of the comments in Listing X.3 using variable names.

.Figure X.1 -- Variable name dissection
image:ch01/syntax.png[image,width:700]

Precise variable names are not only more concise but they help avoid
inaccurate comments. Consider, for example, what can happen when a
teammate updates a few names. It is all too easy to make a mistake when
updating the comments as shown in Listing X.4. If we instead rely on
variable names this problem goes away.

.Listing X.4 -- Good intentions and bad comments
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
// 'creators' is an object constructor we get by   # <1>
// calling 'makers'. The first positional argument # <2> <3>
// of 'makers' must be a string, and it directs
// the type of object constructor to be returned.
// 'makers' uses a closure to remember the type    # <4>
// of object the returned function is to
// meant to create.
//
var makers = builders( null, 'house' );

// == Prefer ==
var make_abode = curry_make_fn({ _item_type_ : 'abode' });
----
<1> Mistake: `creators` is now `makers`
<2> Mistake: `makers`   is now `builders`
<3> Mistake: The string is now the second positional parameter
<4> Mistake: `makers` is now `builders`

The changes to the preferred code are far shorter and guaranteed
correct. Good editors can apply variable-name changes throughout a
project in second whereas comment management is the developer's
responsibility.

=== Use common characters
- Use the characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, underscore, and `$`, for
variable names and all other symbols such as labels or property keys.
- Don’t begin a name with a number.

.Listing X.5 -- Keyboard characters
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
my_obj[ '00-x__®__' ] = 'hello';

// == Prefer ==
my_obj._greet_str_ = 'hello';
----

Limit variable names to characters available on most of the world’s
keyboards. Apply the same character limits to object property names
since all variables are object properties of their functional scope.

=== Communicate variable scope
- Place each module in its own file
- Use `camelCase` when the variable is module scope.
- Use `snake_case` when the variable is local to a function
  nested inside the module.
- Use two or more syllables for module-scope variables.

.Listing X.6 -- Variable scope names
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var stateMap = {};  # <1>
function initModuleFn () {
  var 
    localInt = 1,   # <2>
    localStr = 'Module initialized. Our number is '
    ;
 console.log( localStr + localInt );
}
return { _initModuleFn_ : initModuleFn };

// == Prefer ==
var stateMap = {};  # <1>
function initModuleFn () {
  var 
    local_int = 1,  # <3>
    local_str = 'Module initialized. Our number is '
    ;
 console.log( local_str + local_int );
}
return { _initModuleFn_ : initModuleFn };
----
<1> Module scope
<2> Avoid: Local scope variables use camelCase
<3> Prefer: Local scope variables use snake_case

=== Communicate variable type
Add a suffix or prefix to a variable name to identify its intended data
type. Avoid changing a variable type after declaration because it causes
confusion and rarely provides any benefit. When in doubt use an “unknown
type” indicator.

.Listing X.7 -- Type indicators
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var
  places = 10,
  users = '02',
  calc = places + users;
console.log ( calc ); # <1>

// == Prefer ===
var
  place_count = 10,
  user_id     = '02',
  calc_num    = place_count + Number( user_id );
console.log ( calc_num ); # <2>
----
<1> Displays the string '1002'
<2> Displays the number '12'

==== Booleans
Name boolean variables using `<noun>_<type>` or `<type>_<noun>`.
Recommended `<type>` indicators are shown in Table X.1. Boolean
`<type>` indicators are often prefixes because they read better in English.
Most other `<type>` indicators are suffixes.

.Table X.1 -- Boolean indicators
[cols="",]
|============================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_bool [generic] |return_bool |returnBool
|do_ (requests action) |do_retract |doRetract

==== Integers
Name integer variables using `<noun>-<type>`. Recommended `<type>`
indicators are shown in Table X.6.

.Table X.6-- Integer indicators
[cols="",]
|================================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_int [generic] |size_int |sizeInt
|_count |user_count |userCount
|_idx |user_idx |userIdx
|_ms (milliseconds) |click_delay_ms |clickDelayMs
|i, j, k (convention) |i |--
|_toid, _intid |show_popup_toid |showPopUpToid
|================================================

JavaScript requires an integer value for a number of purposes such as an
index for an array, or as an argument for `indexOf`, or
`subStr`. Consider, for example, what happens if we try to use a
float for an array index as shown in Listing X.8.

.Listing X.8 -- Array with a non-integer index
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
const color_list = [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ];
color_list[1.5] = 'chartreuse';
console.log( color_list.pop() ); // 'blue'
console.log( color_list.pop() ); // 'green'
console.log( color_list.pop() ); // 'red'
console.log( color_list.pop() ); // *undefined???*
console.log( color_list[1.5]  ); // *oh, there it is*
console.log( color_list       ); // *["1.5":"chartreuse"]*
----

==== Lists
Name array variables using `<noun>-<type>`. Recommended `<type>`
indicators are shown in Table X.7. Please use only singular nouns
as the suffix indicates plurality. We recommend using the `<table>`
suffix for complex data structures such as a list-of-lists or
a list-of-objects.

.Table X.7 -- List indicators
[cols="",]
|====================================================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_list [generic] | timestamp_list, color_list | timestampList, colorList
|_table [complex lists] |user_table |userTable
|====================================================================

==== Numbers
Name floating-point number variables using `<noun>-<type>`. Recommended
`<type>` indicators are shown in Table X.8. Please use only singular nouns
as the suffix indicates plurality.

.Table X.8 -- Number indicators
[cols="",]
|======================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_num [generic] |size_num |SizeNum
|_coord |x_coord |xCoord
|_px (fractional unit) |x_px, y_px |xPx
|_ratio |sale_ratio |saleRatio
|x,y,z |x |--
|======================================

==== Maps
Name variables used as maps using `<noun>-<type>`. Recommended `<type>`
indicators are shown in Table X.9. Please use only singular nouns as the
suffix indicates plurality. We recommend using the `<matrix>`
suffix for complex data structures such as a map-of-lists or a map-of-maps.

.Table X.9 -- Map indicators
[cols="",]
|============================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
a|
_map [generic]

_matrix [complex maps]

 a|
employee_map

receipt_map

user_matrix

 a|
employeeMap

receiptMap

userMatrix

|============================================

Maps are simple objects used to store key-value pairsfootnoteref:[es5map,
As of ES5 there also a new `Map` data type which provides somewhat more
nuanced capabilities but with a clumsier interface and partial support in
older browsers (notably IE 11).]. This is similar to a `map` in Java,
a `dict` in Python, an `associative array` in PHP, or a `hash` in Perl.

==== Objects

Name full-featured object variables using `<noun>-<type>. Recommended
`<type>` indicators are shown in Table X.10.

.Table X.10 -- Object indicators
[cols="",]
|=========================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_obj [generic] a|
employee_obj

receipt_obj

error_obj

 a|
employeeObj

$areaTabs

|_proto (prototype) |user_proto |userProto
|=========================================

==== Regular expression objects

Name regular expression object variables using `<noun>-<type>`. The
recommended `<type>` indicator is shown in Table X.11.

.Table X.11 -- Regex indicator
[cols="",]
|====================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_rx |match_rx |matchRx

|_msg (message) |employee_msg |employeeMsg
|_name |employee_name |employeeName
|_text |email_text |emailText
|_type |item_type |itemType
|===========================================

==== Unknown types

Name variable of an unknown type using `<noun>-<type>`. The recommended
`<type>` indicator is shown in Table X.13.

.Table X.13 -- Unknown type indicator
[cols="",]
|====================================
|Indicator |Local scope |Module scope
|_data a|
http_data

socket_data

arg_data

data

 a|
httpData,

socketData

|====================================

Variables with unknown types are encountered in polymorphic functions
where an argument may have one of many types. One such function might
concatenate strings, numbers, arrays, or maps. We also encounter unknown
data types when receiving data from an external source such as an AJAX
response.

=== Avoid plurals

Avoid plurals in *any* variable name. A plural noun implies an
indeterminate group of data. Instead use a variable name that more
precisely identifies the type of data that contains the group.

.Listing X.9 -- Collections of data
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var
  cats = [ 'callico', 'tabby' ],
  colors = { blue : '#00f', green : '#0f0', red : '#00f' },
  persons = [ { name : 'Fred' }, [ name : 'Wilma' } ],
  retracts = true,
  users = 'Betty,Bamm-Bamm,Fred,Pebbles,Wilma'
 ;

// == Prefer ==
var
  cat_list      = [ 'callico', 'tabby' ],
  color_map     = { blue : '#00f', green : '#0f0', red : '#00f' },
  do_retract    = true,
  person_table  = [ { name : 'fred' }, [ name : 'wilma' } ],
  user_csv_list = 'Betty,Bamm-Bamm,Fred,Pebbles,Wilma'
  ;
----

=== Sort declarations and assignments
Sort declarations and assignment of variables, lists, and maps in
alphabetical order unless there is a precedence requirement or another
obvious reason for a different order. Use an editor like Vim, Sublime,
or WebStorm which support in-line sorting.

.Listing X.10 -- Sorted declarations
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===

var
  do_retract = true,
  color_map = { green : '#0f0', red : '#00f', blue : '#00f' },
  person_table = [ { name : 'Wilma' }, { name : 'Fred' } ],
  user_csv_list = 'Pebbles,Wilma,Betty,Bamm-Bamm,Fred',
  cat_list = [ 'tabby', 'callico' ]
  ;

// == Prefer ==
var
  cat_list = [ 'callico', 'tabby', ],
  color_map = { blue : '#00f', green : '#0f0', red : '#00f' },
  do_retract = true,
  person_table = [ { name : 'fred' }, [ name : 'wilma' } ],
  user_csv_list = 'Betty,Bamm-Bamm,Fred,Pebbles,Wilma';
  ;
----

=== Object property names
Name object properties using the same convention as other variables.
Properties we intend to have compressed should be wrapped with
underscores so they can be identified during the build process.

.Table X.14 -- Example property names
[cols="",]
|===========================================================
|Type |Local scope |Module scope
|Array |local_map.\_person_list_ |spa.\_model_.\_personList_
|Boolean |local_map.\_is_enabled_ |spa.\_model_.\_isReady_
|Function |local_map.\_init_fn_ a|
spa.\_initModuleFn_
spa.\_model_.initModuleFn_
spa.\_shell_._initModuleFn_
|Integer |local_map._leg_count_ |spa.\_model_.\_callbackCount_
|Map |local_map.\_user_map_ |spa.\_slider_.\_instanceMap_
|Number |local_map.\_mix_ratio_ |spa.\_sound_.\_mixRatio_
|String |local_map.\_username_ |spa.\_model_.\_userMap_
|Regex |local_map.\_match_rx_ |spa.\_matchRx_
|===========================================================

== Functions
Functions are a first-class data type in JavaScript. They can be
used as with any other type. We can, for example, create a map or array
with them as values, or use them as arguments in other functions.

=== Use namespaces
When running JavaScript in a browser we need to protect our code from
conflict. Create a single global namespace map inside of which all our other
variables are scopedfootnoteref:[iife,NodeJS transparently creates an IIFE
for each module file so you don't have to].
Use an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (`IIFE`) to create the
namespace as shown in Listing X.11. When declaring an `IIFE` always wrap
the outer function in parenthesis so that it’s clear obvious the value
produced is the result of the function and not the function itself.
Always use the `'use strict'` pragma for module-scope `IIFEs`.

.Listing X.11 -- A namespace map created using an `IIFE`
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ==
var greetStr = 'Hi there!';
console.log( window.greetStr ); // prints 'Hi there!'

// == Prefer ==
var spa = (function () {
  'use strict';
  var greetStr = 'Hi there!';
  function initModuleFn () { console.log( greetStr ); }
  return { _initModuleFn_ : initModuleFn };
}());
spa._initModuleFn_();
----

We can break a namespace into manageable subdivisions. For example, we
can add `spa.\_shell_` and `spa.\_slider_` to our `spa`
namespace as shown in Listing X.12.

.Listing X.12 -- A namespace subdivided
[source,js]
----
// == Prefer ==
// In the file spa.shell.js:
spa._shell_ = (function () {
 'use strict';

 return {       # <1>
 _initModuleFn_   : initModuleFn,
 _resetDisplayFn_ : resetDisplayFn
 };
}());

// In the file spa.slider.js:
spa._slider_ = (function () {
 'use strict';

 return {        # <1>
 _initModuleFn_    : initModuleFn,
 _extendSliderFn_  : extendSliderFn,
 _retractSliderFn_ : retractSliderFn
 };
}());
// Initialize the spa from another module
spa._initModuleFn_();
----
<1> Return private variables and methods

Name CSS selectors in parallel with the JavaScript namespaces. For
example, any classes used by `spa.\_shell_` should have an `spa-\_shell_`
prefix.

=== Minimize module-scope variables
Do not use global variables except when namespacing as above.
It is also wise to minimize module-scope variables otherwise one can lose
track of module state. We recommend grouping state and configuration data
into `stateMap` and `configMap` respectively as shown in Listing X.13.

.Listing X.13 -- Module scope variables
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var
  doBigThings = true,
  userMaxCount = 5,
  isSliderActive = true,
  isSliderOpen = false
  ;

// == Prefer ==
var
  configMap = {
    _do_big_things_  : true,
    _user_max_count_ : 5
  },
  stateMap = {
   _is_slider_active_ : true,
   _is_slider_open_   : false
  };
----

=== Use named functions
Named functions are easier to debug than anonymous functions.
For most purposes the declarations in Listing X.14 are
equivalent. However, we *will* see a difference when debugging.
When we declare functions with an explicit names, legible
stack traces can be computed prior to run-time.

.Listing X.14 -- Explicit function names
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
getMapCopy = function ( arg_map ) { ... }; # <1>

// == Prefer ==
function getMapCopy( arg_map ) { ... };    # <2>
----
<1> This is an anonymous function assigned to a variable.
<2> This is a named function.

=== Use named arguments for complex functions
Positional argument, while convenient for simple function, are not
self documenting and become unwieldy when the list grows longer
than two. Use named arguments instead as shown in Listing X.15.

.Listing X.15 -- Named arguments
[source,js]
----
// == Good ====
hypotenuse_num = sqrt( 25 ); # <1>

// == Avoid ===
coor_map = refactorCoords( 22, 28, 32, 48); <2>

// == Prefer ==
coord_map = refactorCoords({
 x1 : 22, y1 : 28, x2 : 32, y2 : 48 <3>
});
----
<1> Positional arguments are fine for simple functions.
<2> But they can get confusing when the list grows.
<3> The purpose of these named arguments is clearer.

=== Use a single var statement per function
Declare all variables at the top of a function using a
single `var` keyword first as shown in Listing X.16.

----

If we declare a variable anywhere within a function using `var`,
it will be initialized with a value of `undefined` immediately
on invocation. Declaring a variable is not the same as assigning a value to it.
When a variable is declared, the JS engine know which it exists within
a functional scope and this is processed at compile-time. A value can be
assigned to a variable only at run-timefootnoteref:[hoist,This is
the source of the infamous "JavaScript Hoisting" 'bugs'.]. As a convenience
we may combine declaration and assignment with the `var` statement 
but internally the JavaScript engine will always process both 
stages at different times.

As of ES5.1 `let` is preferred over `var` in most cases. But there
is one glaring problem: not all tool chains support it. For example, jQuery
and UglifyJS and a bunch of other libraries still expect `var` behavior.
We've discovered this the hard way. So despite all the benefits of `let`,
we're going to allow its use catch up with its promise before we join the
party.

The `const` keyword is also preferred over `var`. Just like with `let` there
are tool-chain issues. Listing X.17 shows how a `const` symbol is not as
immutable as one might think.

.Listing X.17 -- Confusing `const`
[source,js]
----
'use strict';
const foo_table = [ {}, {} ];
foo_table[ 0 ]._brand_str_ = 'billy'; # <1>
foo_table[ 1 ]._type_      = 'beer';  # <1>

console.warn( JSON.stringify( foo_table ) );
// [ { _brand_str_: 'billy' }, { _type_: 'beer' } ]
----
<1> So much for immutability.

=== Distinguish function declaration and invocation
- Declare a function with a single space between the name and
  opening left parenthesis.
- Invoke a function with no space between the name and
  the opening left parenthesis.

.Listing X.18 -- Function declaration and invocation
[source,js]
----
function processMap( arg_map ){ ... }     // == Avoid ===
function processMap ( arg_map ) { ... }   // == Prefer ==

result_map = processMap ( example_map );  // == Avoid ===
result_map = processMap( example_map );   // == Prefer ==
----

=== Compare with precision
Use the precise `===` and `!==` comparators instead of `==` and `!=`.
The latter operators apply type coercion which is inconsistent
and confusing as shown Listing X.19.

.Listing X.19 -- Check for truthiness
[source,js]
----
var count_list = [ 1 + 1 ];

== Avoid ===
if ( count_list == 2 ) { console.warn( 'Confusing match' ); } # <1>

== Prefer ===
if ( count_list === 2 ) { console.warn( 'No match' ); }   # <2>
----
<1> Both the array and number are coerced into the string '2'.
<2> No type coercion occurs.

=== Catch exceptions
Exceptions should be caught using a try-catch block.
Avoid nested blocks as shown in Listing X.20 and use a
linear search instead as shown in Listing X.21.

.Listing X.20 -- Try-catch block -- nesting
[source,js]

      }
      catch ( error3_data ) {
        console.warn( String( error3_data ) );
      }
    }
  }

    console.warn( String( catch_data ) );
  }
}

if ( fs_obj ) {
  console.log( 'Found library ' + lib_key );

----

=== Prefer factory objects
Use `{}` or `[]` instead of `new Object()` or `new Array()` to
create a new object or array. If you require object inheritance, use
`Object.create( obj_proto )` and use the factory pattern for object
constructors shown in Listing X.22. This emphasizes the prototype object
inheritance in JavaScript.

.Listing X.22 -- Factory object constructor
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var dog = new Dog();

// == Prefer ==
var dog_obj = makeDogObjFn();
----

===  Use labels for clarity
Labels may be used with `while`, `do`, `for`, or `switch` blocks.
They clarify the purpose of a `continue` or `break` statement and make the
logic more resistant to nesting errors as shown in Listing X.23.

.Listing X.23 -- Labeled statements
[source,js]
----
// == Prefer ==
var
  horse_list  = [ 'Anglo-Arabian', 'Clydsedale' ],
  horse_count = horseList.length,
  solve_list  = [],

  breed_name, idx, idj
  ;

_HORSE_: for ( idx = 0; idx < horse_count; idx++ ) {
  breed_name = horse_list[ idx ];
  _LEG_ : for ( idj = 0; idj < 4; idj++ ) {
    if ( Math.random() < 0.5 ) { continue _LEG_; } # <1>
    if ( Math.random() < 0.1 && breed_name === 'Clydesdale' ) {
      break _HORSE_; # <2>
    }
    solve_list.push( breed_name + ' ' + String( idj ) );
  }
}

console.log( JSON.stringify( solve_list ) );
----
<1> Skip iteration of inner loop
<2> Break out of outer loop

=== Return the intended value
The return value must start on the same line as the `return`
keyword to avoid semicolon insertion as shown in Listing X.24.

.Listing X.24 -- Return without errors
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
return
  ( { _make_house_fn_ : make_house_fn } );

// == Prefer ==
return { _make_house_fn_ : make_house_fn };
----

=== Copy with care
The values in complex variables such as arrays and objects are not
copied when they are assigned. Instead, the pointer to the data is copied
as shown in Listing X.25. We highly recommend the use of deep copy routines
to avoid data corruption.

.Listing X.25
----
var age_map, copy_map;

// == Avoid ===
age_map = { 'Bob' : 36 };
copy_map = age_map;              # <1>

copy_map.Amanda = 54;
console.log( age_map );

// == Prefer ==
function cloneData ( data ) {
  try { return JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( data ) ); }
  catch ( error_data ) { return; }
}
age_map = { 'Bob' : 36 };
copy_map = cloneData( age_map ); # <2>

copy_map.Amanda = 54;
console.log( age_map );
----
<1> age_map and copy_map are pointers to the same map
<2> copy_map is a deep copy of age map

=== Break after each case block
Every `case` block inside a `switch` closure -- with the exception
of `default` -- should end with `break`, `return`, or `throw`
as shown in Listing X.26.

.Listing X.26 -- Avoid fall-through
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ==
switch ( <expression> ) {
  case <value1>:
  case <value2>:
    // statements
  case <value3>:
    // statements
  default:
    // statements # <1>
}

// == Prefer ==
switch ( <expression> ) {
  case <value1>:
  case <value2>:
    // statements
    break;
  case <value3>:
    // statements
    break;
  default:
    // statements # <2>
}
----
<1> All case blocks will execute
<2> Only one matching case block will execute

One may safely nest `switch` statements by using labeled `breaks`.

=== Don't use these features

==== The comma operator
Avoid the use of the comma operator found in some `for` loop
constructs. This doesn’t apply to the comma separator, which is used in
object literals, array literals, variable declarations, and parameter
lists.

==== Assignment expressions
Avoid using an assignment as as test condition as it is unexpected and
confusing.

.Listing X.27 Assignment expressions
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var
  random_int = Math.floor( Math.random() * 2 ),
  set_int
  ;

if ( set_int = random_int ) {
  console.warn( 'random int is not 0' );
}

// == Prefer ==
var
  random_int = Math.floor( Math.random() * 2 ),
  set_int = random_int
  ;

if ( random_int !== 0 ) {
 console.warn( 'random int is not 0' );
}
----

==== Endless loops
Avoid the `do`, `while` and `setInterval` statements as they are all prone
to endless loop conditions by default. Instead, prefer the self limiting
`for` and `setTimeout` statements, as shown in Listing X.28.

.Listing X.28 Endless loop love
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
totalCount = 0;
function bumpFn () { totalCount++ };
setInterval( bumpFn, 1000 ); # <1>

// == Prefer
totalCount = 0;
function bumpFn () {
  totalCount++;
  if ( totalCount < 10 ) {   # <2>
    setTimeout( bumpFn, 1000 );
  }
}
bumpFn();
----
<1> This will continue as long as the application is loaded
<2> This is limited to 10 repetitions

=== The with statement
Avoid the `with` statement. Instead use the `object.call()` family
of methods adjust the value of `this` during function
invocation.

=== Confusing plus and minus operators
Be careful to not follow a + with a + or a ++. This pattern can be
confusing. Insert parentheses between them to make your intention clear
as shown in Listing X.29.

.Listing X.29 -- Confusing signs
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
total = total_count + +arg_map._cost_int_;

// == Prefer ==
total = total_count + ( +arg_map._cost_int_);
----

This prevents the `+ +` from being misread as `++`. The same
guideline applies for the minus sign.

=== eval
JavaScript will attempt to `eval` (evaluate and execute) a string
variable in numerous situations. Avoid them all to enhance security
and performance.

- Don’t use the `Function` constructor with a string as this performs
an `eval`.
- Don’t pass strings to `setTimeout` or `setInterval` as this
performs an `eval`.
- Don’t use `eval` to process `JSON` data. Use `JSON.parse( <string> )` to
convert JSON string into a data structure and `JSON.stringify( <data> )` to
convert a data structure into a string.

== Format and documentation
=== Format for 80 column displays
- Use a document width of 80 characters.
- Indent two spaces per code level.
- Don’t use tab characters.
- Place white space between operators and variables.
- Place white space after every comma.
- Use only one statement or variable assignment per line.
- Place a semicolon at the end of every statement.

Listing X.30 shows these rules in practice.

.Listing X.30 -- Formatting for 80 columns
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
function makePctStr(arg_ratio,arg_count,arg_sigil_str){
        var ratio=castNum(arg_ratio,0),
                count=castNum(arg_count,0),
                sigil_str=castStr(arg_sigil_str,'%'),
                count=count<0?0:Math.floor(count);

        return # <1>
        { pct_str:(ratio*100).toFixed(count)+sigil_str };
}

// == Prefer ==
function makePctStr ( arg_ratio, arg_count, arg_sigil_str ) {
  var
    count     = castNum( arg_count,       0 ),
    ratio     = castNum( arg_ratio,       0 ),
    sigil_str = castStr( arg_sigil_str, '%' ),
    count     = count < 0 ? 0 : Math.floor( count )
    ;

  return {
    pct_str : ( ratio * __100 ).toFixed( count ) + sigil_str
  };
}
----
<1> This results in a semicolon insertion bug where the return value is
undefined.

Keep the document width below 80 characters so that it fits within
a standard terminal window and reads well on constrained displays such
as those found on mobile devices and is easy to comprehendfootnoteref:[typog,
Line widths of 66 characters are considered optimal for comprehension.
See Binghust, R. (2004) The Elements of Typographic Style (3rd edition),
New York.]. Indent two spaces per level to avoid exceeding the document
width when code is nested. Use spaces for indentation not tabs as they
display consistently on all devices.

Place white space around operators, variables, and commas to assist with
legibility. This has no effect on application performance as it
will be concatenated, minified, and compressed before it reaches end
users.

Place only one statement or assignment per line. One may, however, declare
multiple variables on a single line to save space. Explicitly terminate
every statement with a semicolon to avoid semicolon insertion bugs.

=== Use Stroustrup-style bracketing
- Place the opening parenthesis, brace, or bracket at the end of the
  line.
- Indent the code inside the delimiters (parenthesis, brace, or bracket)
  one level.
- Place the closing parenthesis, brace or bracket on its own line with
- same indentation as the opening line.
- Do not omit braces on *any* single-line statement.

Listing X.31 shows these rules in practice.

.Listing X.31 -- Stroustrup-style bracketing

  else if (arg_num === 0)
  {
    solve_int = 0;
  } else {
    solve_int = 1;
  }
  return solve_int;
}

// == Prefer ==

  }
  else if ( arg_num === 0 ) {
    solve_int = 0;
  }
  else {
    solve_int = 1;
  }
  return solve_int;
}
----

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_Stroustrup[Stroustrup
style] is a _one-true-brace_ variant of K&R-style that does not cuddle
else clauses. Many feel it nicely balances brevity, clarity, and
safety.

=== Organize and comment by paragraphs
- Group code in logical paragraphs and place blank lines between each.
- Vertically align operators within paragraphs.
- Indent comments the same amount as the code they explain.
- Comment once per paragraph.

Listing X.32 shows how cluttered and noisy comments can get. Listing X.33
shows comments applied by paragraph.

.Listing X.32 -- Avoid comments per line
[source,js]

// == Avoid ===
function shuffle( items ) {
  // Items should be an array.
  // Return false if argument is not an array
  if ( ! Array.isArray( items ) ) { return false; }

  var size = items.length;
  // Decrement i from the size of the list to 1
  for ( var i = size; i > 0; i-- ) {
    // x is the int element index at the end of the section.
    var x = i - 1;
    // y is a random integer index within the section.
    var y = Math.floor( Math.random() * i );
    // Get random element value. Swap could be any data type.
    var swap = items[ y ];
    // Set random element value to same as end of section
    items[ y ] = items[ x ];
    // Set end of section value to random element value

    swap_data = list[ last_idx ];

    list[ last_idx ] = list[ pick_idx ];
    list[ pick_idx ] = swap_data;
  }
  return true;
}
----

Rely on the name convention to explain variable content and purpose.
Use a capable editor like Vim, Sublime, or WebStorm which support vertical
selection and alignment. WebStorm can be configured align map
values and assignments within paragraphs.

=== Document APIs in-line
Document any nontrivial function API inline. A template is provided in
Listing X.34. Place architecture plans in documents separate from the code.

.Listing X.34 -- Inline API documentation
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
function shuffle( items ) { ... }

// Throws    : <any exceptions, or 'none'>
// Technique : <overview of algorithm>
//
function shuffleListFn( arg_list ) { ... }
// . END public method /shuffleListFn/
----

=== Mark future tasks with TODOs
Create `TODO` comments for tasks that can not be complete immediately
as shown in Listing X.35. These have become standard enough that WebStorm,
ESLint, Vim, and many other tools recognize them.

.Listing X.35 -- A TODO comment
[source,js]
----
// TODO <date> <username> <urgency>: <notes>
// TODO 2019-05-01 bubba alert : Disabled while testing alternate

----

The `<date>` field conveys the freshness of the comment and should be
expressed in ISO YYYY-MM-DD format, for example, 2019-05-01.
The `<username>` field should be the identification of the author.
The `<urgency>` field explains how critical the task is. We recommend using
 syslog levels as these are well known footnoteref:[syslog,Syslog levels in
 decending order of urgency include `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warn`,
`notice`, `info`, or `debug`]. We can check a list of all TODOs in a project
as shown in Listing X.36.

.Listing X.36 -- Listing TODOs
[source,js]
----
grep TODO $(find ./ -type f -name '*.js' \
  | grep -v node_modules |grep -v /vendor/) |sort -u
----

=== Annotate disabled code
It is wise to disable a code block and only delete it when we are
certain it will no longer be useful. This prevents team members from
solving the same problem multiple times. Disabled code should be
identified by a `TODO` comment as shown in Listing X.37.

.Listing X.37 -- Disabled code with an explanation
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
// while ( k > 0 ) { … }

// == Prefer ==
// BEGIN TODO 2019-05-01 bubba warn: Disabled for testing
// while ( k > 0 ) { … }
// ...
// . END TODO 2019-05-01 bubba warn
----

Search and resolve `TODOs` regularly -- once a week is good -- by
recording them in the organization’s issue tracking database. Convert
each comment as each issue is entered as shown in Listing X.38

.Listing X.38 -- An issue comment
[source,js]
----
// == Prefer == (issue ID used to explain disabled code)
// Issue #96785: Disabled while testing alternative
// while ( k > 0 ) { ... }
----

=== Break lines on operators
- Prefer single lines when possible.
- Break lines before operators or after comma separators.
- Indent subsequent lines of the statement one level.
- Optionally place the terminating semicolon on its own line to
  end multi-line statements.

.Listing x.39 -- Break lines on operators
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
var full_address_str = first_name + ' ' + last_name +
  '\n' + street1_str + '\n' + street2_str + '\n' +
  city_str + ',' + state_code + ' ' + zip_code;

// == Prefer ==
var full_address_str
  = first_name + ' ' + last_name + '\n'
  + street1_str + '\n'
  + street2_str + '\n'
  + city_str + ','
  + state_code + ' ' + zip_code
  ;
----

Place all statements and declarations within our document width on a
single line. Break any statement or declaration that exceeds our document
width into multiple lines. Break before operators so they are aligned on the
left column. This highlights the action taking place on the data.
Indent all continuation lines one level.

=== Delimit literals with single quotes
Prefer single quotes (`'`) over double quotes (`"`) when delimiting string
literals. This communicates that JavaScript does not expand embedded
variables name just with single-quoted strings in many other popular
languages. Quoting HTML is also much easier as shown in Listing X.40.

.Listing X.40 -- Single quotes and literal strings
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
link_str = "<a href=\"/wiki/fish\" title=\"fish\">fish</a>";

// == Prefer ==
link_str = '<a href="/wiki/fish" title="fish">fish</a>';
----

ECMA2015 introduced template literals where grave accent delimiters (```)
work much like double quotes (`"`) in many other languages. As of late
2017, only Firefox supports template literals fully.

=== Prefer C-style ‘for’ syntax
Use the C-style form of the `for` statement. Avoid the
`for-in` form as this iterates over inherited object properties which
are unreliable. Instead use `Object.keys()` to get a list of property
names and iterate over that as shown in Listing X.41.

.Listing X.41 -- C-style ‘for’ syntax
[source,js]
----
// == Avoid ===
for ( key in cat_obj ) {
  if ( cat_obj.hasOwnProperty( key ) ) {
    // process key
  }
}

// == Prefer ==
key_list  = Object.keys( cat_obj );
key_count = key_list.length;
for ( idx = 0; idx < key_count; idx++ ) {
  key = obj_list[ idx ];
  // process key
}
----

=== Before and after
Listings X.42 and X.43 compare the readability of an object prototype
before and after applying the recommended formatting.

};
----

== Layout JS and CSS files by namespace
- Place JavaScript files used by the web application under a directory
called `js.`
- Name JavaScript files according to the namespace they provide, one
namespace per file. All files should have the `.js` suffix as shown in
Listing X.44.
- Use the template to start any JavaScript module file. This is found
in the `hi_score` project at `js/xhi/xhi-module-template.js`.
- Place all CSS files used by the web application in a directory
called `css`.
- Maintain a parallel structure between JavaScript and CSS files and
class names. Create a CSS file for each JavaScript file that generates
HTML. All files should have the `.css` suffix as shown below.
- Prefix CSS selectors according to the name of the module they
support. This practice helps greatly to avoid unintended interaction
with classes from third-party modules as shown in Listing X.44.
- Use `<namespace>\_x_<descriptor>_` for state-indicator selectors and other
shared class names. Examples include `spa-\_x_select_` and
`spa-\_x_disabled_`. Place these in the root namespace stylesheet,
for example `spa.css`.
- When using PowerCSS, keep the same parallel structure, replacing CSS
files with JS files as shown in Listing X.44.
- Include third-party JavaScript files first in HTML so their
functions may be evaluated and made ready for our application.
- Include custom JavaScript files next, in order of namespace. We
can’t load namespace `spa.shell`, for example, if the root
namespace, `spa`, has not yet been loaded.

.Listing X.44 -- Namespaced files
[source,js]
----
// == Prefer == JS files
js/spa.js             # <1>
js/spa.shell.js       # <2>
js/spa.slider.js      # <3>

// == Prefer == CSS files

css/spa.shell.css     # <2> <5>
css/spa.slider.css    # <3> <6>

// == Alternate CSS generator files
js/spa.css.js         # <1> <4>
js/spa.css_shell.js   # <2> <5>
js/spa.css_slider.js  # <3> <6>
----
<1> Claims spa JavaScript namespace
<2> Claims spa.\_shell_ JavaScript namespace
<3> Claims spa.\_slider_ JavaScript namespace
<4> Defines #spa, .spa-\_x_clearall_.
<5> Defines spa-\_shell_, spa-\_shell_header_, .spa-\_shell_footer_,
 and .spa-\_shell_main_
<6> Defines .spa-\_slider_open_, .spa-\_slider_closed_

These conventions make the interplay between CSS and JavaScript easier
to manage and debug.

== Code Validation
ESLint is a popular JavaScript validation tool that is more configurable
than the venerable JSLint. Use it to identify errors and ensure
best practice.

=== Install ESLint
We may install ESLint globally as shown in Listing X.45.

.Listing X.45 -- Install ESLint
[source,js]
----
sudo npm install -g eslint
----

=== Configure ESLint
Our settings for are shown in Listing X.46. These are 
added to the `package.json` file at the root of the project.

        }
      ],
      "no-plusplus" : "off"
    }
  },
  ...
}

=== Verify JavaScript
Check JavaScript validity as shown in Listing x.47.

.Listing x.47 -- Lint changed files
[source,js]
----
node_modules/.bin/eslint $( \
  find -type f -name '*.js' \
    | grep -v vendor |grep -v node_modules |grep -v build \
  )

=== Share IDE configuration
WebStorm has excellent code inspection tools (see `Tools` > `Inspect code`).
The `hi_score` project has code inspection settings available at
`config/webstorm_settings.jar` which may be imported using `File` > `Import
 settings`.

== Choose libraries wisely
See "The Fog of SPA" on how too many libraries can result in greater
complexity when developing a JavaScript application.

== Exercises
[quanda]
How does a code standard improve products?::
  A standard provides team members a common dialect and practices so they
  may better understand and collaborate with each other. A good standard
  will encourage documentation, code reuse, and empahsize the benefits of
  the language. It also helps developers avoid common mistakes,
  and techical debtfootnoteref:[techdebt].
Why is indicating variable type especially useful for JavaScript?::
  Because JavaScript variables can contain any type without any indication
  whatsoever. Directly naming variables by expected type can remove the
  constant need for expensive manual or automated introspection.
Should one avoid plurals in variable names?::
  Yes, plurals imply a collection of items. At worst this is simply wrong,
  when, for example, a developer users `runs` as a boolean. At best there
  are far more exact ways to indicate a collection of items.
  For example, instead of `users`, consider `user_list`, `user_map`, or
  `people_obj`.
What are the dangers of imprecise comparators like `==` or `!=`?::
  Imprecise comparators will convert values in complex and unpredictable
  ways. Using a a precise comparison forces the developer to fully understand
  the comparison and avoid subtle bugs.
Which is better: `setTimeout` instead of `setInterval`?::
  The `setInterval` method will invoke a function indefinitely unless
  actively stopped. This is easy to get wrong.
  Alternately we can use the `setTimeout` method to invoke a function once
  and then have it call itself if it needs to run again. This approach
  is self-limiting and hard to get wrong.
Why are labels useful with `break` or `continue`?::
  A `break <label>` or `continue <label>` statement explicitly declares
  which loop is effected. This illustrates logic and helps prevent errors.
